Title: Accelerate Boolean Constraint Propagation for
       Boolean Satisfiability Solvers with FPGA

Abstract:

Boolean Satisfiability (or SAT) problem is the problem of finding if a 
set of boolean values that satisfies a given boolean formula exists.
SAT, even if it is the first problem proven NP-complete, is used in
fields like circuit design and automatic theorem proving.

The algorithm used to solve SAT problems is arborescent but the most
time consuming operation used in it, the Boolean Constraint
Propagation (BCP), is a good target for hardware acceleration.

Based on the work of John D. Davis, we will explore a BCP co-processor
design for FPGA. We will also see some possible techniques to improve
this design: Content Addressable Memory (CAM) and caching.
